## Lab3 Projects
***Description:** Log in and Sign Up Android App using Firebase Authentication API*

## Features:

- Using Firebase Authentication API as a service provided by Google’s Firebase platform that allows you to authenticate users to your app using various identity providers.
- In this project, I use email/password Authentication.
  + Users can log in or register using email and password via Firebase Authentication.
  + Registration and login are handled using FirebaseAuth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword() and signInWithEmailAndPassword() respectively.
- The email and password are saved locally using SharedPreferences.
- When the app restarts, the login fields are automatically populated.
